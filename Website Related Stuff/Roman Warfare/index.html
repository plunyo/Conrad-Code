        <h2>The Punic Wars</h2>
        <p>The Punic Wars were a series of three wars fought between Rome and Carthage from 264 BC to 146 BC. These conflicts were pivotal in establishing Rome's dominance in the Mediterranean region.</p>
        <h3>First Punic War</h3>
        <p>The First Punic War (264-241 BC) was primarily a naval conflict. Rome's innovation, such as the <em>corvus</em> boarding device, allowed them to win key battles despite initial naval inexperience.</p>
        <h3>Second Punic War</h3>
        <p>The Second Punic War (218-201 BC) featured Hannibal's famous crossing of the Alps to attack Rome. Despite significant victories at battles like Cannae, Carthage ultimately lost due to Rome's strategic resilience and Scipio Africanus' campaign in Africa.</p>
        <h3>Third Punic War</h3>
        <p>The Third Punic War (149-146 BC) ended with the complete destruction of Carthage, ensuring Rome's supremacy over the western Mediterranean.</p>
